# AI-Virtual-Mouse
This project leverages computer vision and AI to create a virtual mouse controlled by hand gestures. Utilizing a webcam, the system tracks hand movements, interprets gestures, and performs mouse operations like moving the cursor and clicking, providing a touchless interface for interacting with a computer.
